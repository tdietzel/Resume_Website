        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p><span class="flashy">I first heard about Epicodus in the summer of 2022 as a way for me to expand my learning and dive deeper into coding. During that time I was working peak season on a farm, 90/100 hour weeks, so there wasn't much room for school. Now that I have lots of free time going into winter I decided it would be the perfect time for a career change.</span></p>
